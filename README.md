# Travel Packing List
#### (React)

A simple React application of creating a list of items to pack for a holiday and keeping track on whether they are packed or not. The application has been crated in Create React App.

## How it works

The application is divided into several components - the form, the packing list and the summary. The user inputs into the form what items need to be packed and how many and can tick off once the items are packed. The user can delete the items from the list as well as sort them alphabetically, chronologically or based on their packed status. A summary displays the total number of items on the list and the percentage of packed items.

## Installation

Run the following code in the terminal:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rachelrodko/travel-packing-list-react.git travel_list
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
## Amendments for the future

I need to migrate this application to Vite as many dependencies are flagged during the installation.
